        <h2>Informational purposes only</h2>
        <p>
          The content on this website is provided for general informational purposes
          only. It is not a substitute for professional medical, psychiatric, or
          psychological advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified
          health provider with questions about your own situation.
        </p>

        <h2>No emergency or crisis services</h2>
        <p>
          This website and our online forms are not monitored for emergencies or
          crisis situations. If you are in immediate danger or experiencing a
          medical or mental health emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest
          emergency room. You may also contact your local crisis line or national
          crisis resources as appropriate for your area.
        </p>

        <h2>No provider–patient relationship through the website</h2>
        <p>
          Visiting this website or submitting an online form does not by itself
          create a provider–patient relationship with MWRS or any individual
          clinician. A therapeutic or clinical relationship is only established
          after you have completed the intake process and begun services with a
          specific provider.
        </p>

          links are provided for convenience only. MWRS does not control and is not
          responsible for the content, privacy practices, or services of any
          third-party websites.
